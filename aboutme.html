        <h1> Tallam Sri Venkata Satya Sai Charan Teja</h1>
        <p>I'm Charan Teja, from India. 
            I have done my under-graduation in the background of Electronics and Communication and graduated in the year 2020. 
            I have joined an Organisation called Wipro PVT Ltd based out in Bangalore location and worked around 1.8 years for
            a client called Suncorp as a Quality Analyst.</p>

        <h3>Favorite Book: The Girl in Room 105 </h3>
        <p> The girl in room 105 is a thriller novel written by Chetan Bhagat. This book keeps you hooked util the End.
            I was so intrigued to find out who killed Zara (the girl who is murdered in the novel) that I couldn't stop reading.
            Though my Speculative guess about the killer was absolutely right, (by the time all characters were introduced)
            but I was wrong about the motive and the reason why she was killed. There are many such twists and tales in the novel, 
            which is one of the primary to love the book.</p>
